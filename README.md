https://adventofcode.com/ is a real fun event - which covertly causes short term performance falls for software developers, some often not understood by line managers :) 

For my side - I was invited by my line manager so we had a collective fall. 

It's held every December - if you want to attend. 

PS: Solutions are not evaluated in terms of O(n) or something, you just need to get it working and find the long integer result. Of course O(n) is a personal bonus.
